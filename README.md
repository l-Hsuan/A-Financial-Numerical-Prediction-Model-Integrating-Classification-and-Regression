
# Project Title: Model Training, Prediction, and Ensemble Integration

This repository contains three key files that demonstrate a comprehensive workflow for training, predicting, and enhancing predictive accuracy by combining outputs from regression and classification models. Below is an overview of each file and its purpose:

## Files Overview

### 1. `class_reg_model_train_pred_output.ipynb`
This notebook is responsible for training regression and classification models, making predictions, and outputting the results. The following key points summarize its functionality:
- **Platform:** The notebook is designed to run on Kaggle.
- **Workflow:** It performs training and prediction for multiple models, saving both the results and the prediction files for further analysis.

### 2. `combind_a.ipynb` and `combind_b.ipynb`
These notebooks focus on improving predictive accuracy by integrating the outputs of regression and classification models through two different methods. They implement:
- Strategies for combining predictions from different models.
- Enhanced methods to leverage the complementary strengths of regression and classification outputs.

### 3. `ensemble.ipynb`
Similar to `combind_a.ipynb` and `combind_b.ipynb`, this notebook works on enhancing predictive accuracy by ensembling model outputs. Key features include:
- Techniques for aggregating predictions from multiple models.
- An emphasis on achieving higher accuracy through ensemble learning approaches.

├── class_reg_model_train_pred_output.ipynb  # Model training and prediction on Kaggle
├── combind_a.ipynb                          # Integration of regression and classification outputs
├── combind_b.ipynb                          # Integration of regression and classification outputs
├── ensemble.ipynb                           # Ensemble learning for predictive accuracy
```

## How to Use
1. **Training and Prediction:** Start with `class_reg_model_train_pred_output.ipynb` to train your models and generate predictions. This file is tailored for execution on Kaggle.
2. **Integration and Enhancement:** Use `combind_a.ipynb`, `combind_b.ipynb`, and `ensemble.ipynb` to integrate and enhance the model outputs. Each notebook employs unique techniques to boost overall predictive performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Kaggle account for running the training and prediction notebook (`class_reg_model_train_pred_output.ipynb`)
- Necessary libraries as mentioned in the individual notebooks

## Summary
This repository provides a complete workflow for training machine learning models, generating predictions, and improving results through integration and ensembling techniques. The combined approach leverages the strengths of regression and classification models to achieve enhanced predictive accuracy.
